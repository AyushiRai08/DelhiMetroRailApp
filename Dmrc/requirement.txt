Python Collection Framework
The collection framework in Python provides an architecture to store and manipulate groups of objects. The built-in data structures in Python, like lists, dictionaries, and sets, serve similar purposes as Java's collections.

Collection Framework Used in This Project
In Graph.py:

List: Similar to Java's ArrayList and LinkedList, Python lists are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size.
Dictionary: Similar to Java's HashMap, Python dictionaries store key-value pairs.
In Heap.py:

Dictionary: Used to store key-value pairs.
List: Used to implement the heap structure.
Data Structures
Data structures are ways of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The data structures used in this project are:

List: Implemented using Python's built-in list class, which is a dynamic array that can resize.
Dictionary: Used to store key-value pairs for quick lookups.
Linked List: Can be implemented manually if needed, though Python's list provides similar functionality.
Heap: Implemented using a combination of lists and dictionaries.
Stack: Can be implemented using lists in Python, following the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Graph: A complex data structure containing vertices and edges connecting these vertices, implemented using lists and dictionaries.
Implementation Overview
The array data structure is implemented using Python's list class, which stores data in contiguous memory locations.
The dictionary data structure is used to store key-value pairs, providing fast access to data.
The stack data structure can be easily implemented using Python lists, leveraging the built-in list methods.
The heap is implemented with the help of lists and dictionaries, where the elements are organized in a specific order.
The graph is implemented using lists and dictionaries to represent vertices and edges effectively.
